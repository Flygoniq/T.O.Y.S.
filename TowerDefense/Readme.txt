We ran into several problems last minute and we intend to hammer these out very quickly (it won't take long) and submit everything required to you guys properly asap (sincere apologies).

Gameplay:
F1 For help (not implemented yet) in game.
WASD to move, click to shoot/select.
1 selects wand (weapon), which you can click to fire at enemies.
3 selects spike trap.  If you look at a trap placement spot, it will highlight green or red based on your money (money ui broken atm, start with 100 spikes cost 50).  You can click to place a spike trap if green.  Spikes do damage.
Enemies hurt you if they touch you and they take away 'door points' if they touch the door (seemingly suddenly broken at random).  Losing all of either ends the game.  Beating all waves also ends the game.

Scenes in unity:
The Menu scene under the Scenese folder opens up the Menu.  The start game button goes to level1, which can also just be started manually.
