   6) finished like a charm. really visually compelling and cute.
2. Polish via Visual/Image Effects.
   1) Vignette effect - Chosen because it fits the theme of our game. The premise is that in the main character's dream, his toy casted a spell over the other toys to escape. The vignette effect makes it feel like we're looking into a dream.
   2) Added a halo in the middle to emphasis the vignette effect
